study document-legacy-java-codebase.md and pick the most important thing to do

IMPORTANT:
- Start a new branch based on main for new tasks
- The task must have a SHIP status from RepoPrompt to be marked as done
- If RepoPrompt is not available, let me know
- commit once RepoPrompt gives the SHIP status
- when you are finished doing the most important thing to do, stop.
- update the document-legacy-java-codebase.md plan when the task is done
